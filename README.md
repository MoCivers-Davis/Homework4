![Quiz App] # Homework4 - Web APIs: Current Events Code Quiz

## Why
Statistics show that students in grades 9-12 are less informed about current world events than students from 20 years ago. This translate to students being ill prepared and having difficulty intermingling with the greater society.  This quiz on current events is used a as tool to guage at a high level how much students know about local and national current events.

## How
This quiz is a multiple choice quiz that ask five simple questions such as the name of the current President of the United States, Who is the richest person on America, Who is the current quaterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, What NFL team do Drew Breez play for, and on what college campus are we located on.

## Technology (successes and challanges) 
This quiz app was developed using tools such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  or basic markups and styling.  Where as JavaScript was used to incorporate functionality.

Some of the areas that I struggled with the most was trying to determine where to incorporate my score tracker that will alert users of thier final score.  I created the code for the score tracker to alert user of thier score after each cycle but it the timing was off.  I tried to place the code for the score tracker  in certain areas but I never seemed to get it to display in the proper sequence.  I also ran out of time for adding the clock.
